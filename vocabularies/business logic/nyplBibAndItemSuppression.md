Suppressed = record is not displayed in the Discovery interface. Bib records and/or attached item records can be suppressed.

Only NYPL-owned items (both ReCAP and locally-stored) items will be suppressed, unless we need to suppress (rather than wholesale-delete) partner-owned ReCAP items that have been removed from the open/shared ReCAP collection or otherwise marked by ReCAP/SCSB as deleted or permanently unavailable to NYPL.

A full rundown of NYPL bib and item suppression logic will be moved to this file once the related mapping is available in nypl-core.
