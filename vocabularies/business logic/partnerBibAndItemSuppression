**Partner-owned record suppression (or deletion from Discvoery)**
If a partner-owned item's collection group designation (aka CGD, found in 900$a) changes from Shared or Open to Private, or if the item's customer code changes to a code without NYPL delivery locations assigned, the item is not available to NYPL and should be suppressed or deleted from Discovery. 

**TBD: implementation of this logic in Discovery may not be for MVP; ReCAP may offer a separate suppression/deletion flag.**

A full rundown of partner-owned record suppression logic will be moved to this file once finalized.

In the meantime, please see the following working doc for an in-progress draft (also contains NYPL bib/item suppression logic):
